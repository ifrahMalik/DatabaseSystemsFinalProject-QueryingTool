Welcome to the cab-project-1 wiki!

The database contains information pertaining to the number of fuel vehicles, electric vehicles, community profile data, and amount of emissions from fuel based passenger vehicles. The ddl.sql file contains the schema for each table in our database. By running the batch file evghg.sh, we create the database and the four tables needed. The four tables are based on the four relations from our schema: **_Electric_vehicles, GHG, Fuel_vehicles, Community_Prof_**. The attributes of the tables are taken from the relational schema from phase 3 of the collaborative project. The primary keys are set when creating a table for the database. In order to populate the tables with the data from our datasets, which are from Sustainable New Jersey's website, the excel datasets were transferred to csv files that contained the relevant data relating to our database tables. The column headers of the csv files for each dataset matched with the attributes of each table in the database. 

The user interface seeks to answer some of our research questions by allowing the user to view data from certain tables grouped from specific queries. The user can view all four tables in the database as well as view certain pieces of data that will answer our research questions. The main question we seek to answer is: Do electric vehicles lower Greenhouse gas emissions in municipalities?

**Phase II Written Proposal**
explain the objective and problem and how our database can provide solution to these problems.

**Phase III**
explain the database model using ER diagram. It gives the reasoning behind database design which explain the goals of the sustainability project.

**Phase III** 
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeMap the ER diagram to a relational schema. Estimate database size and types and average number of searches

**Phase IV**
All the relations in the relational schema are normalized to Boyceâ€“Codd normal form (BCNF). Defines the different views (virtual tables) required. For each view list the data and transaction requirements. Give a few examples of queries, in English, to illustrate. Design a complete set of SQL queries to satisfy the transaction requirements identified in the previous stages, using the relational schema and views defined in.

**Final Report**
The final report shows how the database provides a solution to the problem we identified in our proposal earlier. It also focuses on the positive and negative ethical implications of the suggested proposal and explains these concerns in detail.
